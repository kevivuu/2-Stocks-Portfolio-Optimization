This program creates a Minimum Variance Porttfolio for 2 stocks or a risk-driven Complete Portfolio for 2 stocks and 1 bond (assumes to have a 2% annual risk-free return).

Please choose whether you want to invest in bonds (type 'b') or not (type 's').

Then, select 2 out of the 5 F.A.A.N.G. companies (Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) by their stock ticker (META, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG), case insensitive.

If you selected a stock-only portfolio, the program will create a portfolio with the lowest possible risk, showing its expected annual returns and volatility.

If you selected a stock-and-bond portfolio, the program will ask for your Risk Aversion (how much you DISLIKE risk), please enter an integer from 1 to 10. The program then returns the optimal portfolio given your risk preference, showing its expected annual returns and volatility.

An intepretation of the volatility is provided, and so are the returns and volatility of the S&P 500 as a comparison benchmark.
